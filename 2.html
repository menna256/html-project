<p><font color ="white" >AI is relevant to any intellectual task.[192] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive[193] and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect</p>
<p><font color ="white" >High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google Search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays,[195] prediction of judicial decisions,[196] targeting online advertisements, [192][197][198] and energy storage</p>

<p><font color ="white" >With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,[200] major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic</p>

<p><center><font color ="white" >A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.</center></p>

<p><center><font color ="white" >Sophia is a humanoid robot designed by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics. You learn and adapt to human behavior and actions, and to work with humans, by several conferences to the public. In October 2017, Sophia obtained Saudi citizenship, thus becoming the first robot to be granted citizenship.</center></p>
